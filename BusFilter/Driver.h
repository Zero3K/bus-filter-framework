Bus filter sameple driver, based on Bus Filter Framework, or BFF for short,
which is a framework for KMDF-based upper filter drivers to behave as bus
filters. You don't need to write WDM drivers any more!

https://bus-filter-framework.blogspot.com/

This sample driver registers a device interface for every child device, and
prepends "BffDevice" to the compatible IDs list.

Module Name:

    driver.h

Abstract:

    This file contains the driver definitions.

Environment:

    Kernel-mode Driver Framework
